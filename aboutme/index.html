    <h2>Erika Palacios</h2>
    <p>Hey Everyone!</p>
    <p>I am Erika. I am 24 years old. I was born and raised in Guanajuato, Tacolandia better known as Mexico.ðŸ¤ 
    I've been a member of the Church for 6 years now, time flies, doesn't it?</p>
    <p>I was a missionary in the Mexico West Mission and now I'm here, excited to learn - wohoo!
    Oh and I currently have a part time job and I'm not married and I don't have children! </p> 
    <hr> <!-- para que salga una linea de separacion-->

    <p>Some of the things I like to do when I have free time is play the keyboard. I'm not an expert but I love to practice. I love listening to music. </p>
    <p>I always have music playing in the background and I'm almost always discovering new music. I love that! I've learned that the more music you know, the happier you are :)</p>
    <p>I also love going to concerts very much, they are like my safe place. Fun Fact: I'm in like three videos of one of my favorite bands haha! </p>
    <p>I'm studying for a certificate in Web and Computer Programming. I love technology and I love how it can make our lives easier. </p>
    <p>I love the idea of being part of a great project that can help improve people's lives, and technology really does make our lives better. :)</p>
    <hr> <!-- para que salga una linea de separacion-->
    <p>I'm looking forward to meeting you all and working together. I'm not very good at web development, but if you need help I'll try to help or at least we can suffer together haha. ðŸ˜­ </p>
    <p>(I don't have many pictures of me but here's one I literally just took, so that's it.)</p>
